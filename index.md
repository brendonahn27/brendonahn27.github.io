## About Me

Hi! I’m **Brendon Ahn**, a student interested in mathematics—especially **analysis, algebra, and differential equations**.

This website is a personal space where I document my mathematical explorations, research progress, and notes as I learn.

I plan to use this site as:
- A research journal
- A collection of math notes
- A place to share problems and ideas I find interesting
